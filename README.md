# Overview

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database program. It's a versatile resourse that I want to learn to manage because it could helpful for future projects.

# Software

For this project I worked with Javascript, Node JS, Express-Edge and MongoDB

# Purpose

I have been called as a ward executive secretary and one of the first things i did was to look for an efficient way
to keep the bishopric members and myself sync with the agenda of interviews that they need to do.

There are several tools to manage information and responsabilities but I could not find an easy way for them to see
their schedules any time of the day. The official calendar have a lot of events already and the interviews can be
lost through them. I know I could text them individually or through different applications. We can have the list of
interviews that needs to be done on the Church’s website but there is no way to register appointments or follow up them,
mark if already done.

This website will be a visually clean scheduler where the bishop and his counselors can check their next appointments,
the names and reasons of each person they will meet and a tool for the secretaries to make the schedule and follow up
those appointments by marking the ones done and the ones that need to be rescheduled.

# Cloud Database

The structure of MongoDB database is NoSQL, that means that it's doesn't have a forced "tree" structure, it's based on documents with a JSON syntaxis and those can be accessed from different points. the JSON-like documents makes this database cleaner and easier to manage.

My database for this project is simple. It has an active cluster within MongoDB with one dabatabse ("appointments") and inside that there is one collection ("appointments")

# Development Environment

• MacOS
• Visual Studio Code 2

# Future Work

- Dynamic messages on the page for when a record is added or when there's no records at all.
- Frontend visual adjustments for a nicer user interface
- Make the website accesible straight from GitHub
